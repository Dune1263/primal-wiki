                                The Eternity Realm was the first realm ever created, born directly from the Eternal
                                Consciousness. It is the frontier of absolute power, a plane where the True Gods dwell —
                                beings who exist beyond time, matter, and form.
                            </p>

                                From this realm, the gods observe, judge, and uphold the balance of all creation.
                                Every decision taken here echoes across the other realms.

                                The Material Realm was formed as a living masterpiece — a place where life could grow freely.
                                It contains countless worlds, but Earth stands at its centre, the focal point where all
                                elemental currents converge.

                                Here, time flows, choices matter, and destinies intertwine. The Elementals shaped its lands
                                and oceans, and later the mortals inherited their fragments of power.

                                The Void Realm was designed as a neutral barrier between the Material Realm and the Nether.
                                It is the place where the gods discard everything that does not deserve their attention:
                                failed ideas, abandoned essences, fragments of reality not meant to exist.
                            </p>

                                Its function is to separate chaos from life, preventing the influence of the Nether from
                                contaminating creation. There is no light, no sound, no time — only endless stillness.

                                Legends say that Vorlak’s essence wandered the Void for millennia, dormant, until it found

                                The Nether Realm was the first realm brought into existence after Eternity. It was forged
                                as a prison for the Corrupted God — the one who tried to dominate creation and enslave
                                the Elementals.

                                Nether acts as a containment of chaos, where corrupted souls and discarded entities
                                eventually end up. Its energy is dense, corrosive, and unstable.

                                Time flows erratically. Landscapes twist into storms of fire and ash. Inhabitants slowly
